An air pollution monitoring system based on real time satellite data
Pollution control remains a critical challenge for
industries, with the risk of exceeding regulatory limits
leading to severe environmental and health impacts.
Our solution uses satellite-based real-time monitoring
to track pollutant levels like PM2.5, CO2, and NOx. By
sending instant alerts when these levels exceed safe
thresholds, the system enables industries to take
immediate corrective actions. Additionally, predictive
analytics allow for proactive emission control,
ensuring regulatory compliance and safeguarding
worker health by preventing exposure to hazardous
pollution levels.
